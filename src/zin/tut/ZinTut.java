/**
 * The purpose of this project is to learn things by looking at the code
 * Since there can be alot of code. We aim to reduce the number of lines
 * 
 * In future I'm planning to implement some search functionality,
 * every method written is some form of set of questions and
 * the method with its comments are the explanation of the answer.
 * So if someone searches what if we don't override hashcode
 * the code with comments should appear
